            Luv Kohli began his spiritual journey over a decade ago when he discovered the
            profound guidance of tarot and astrology. Through years of study and practice, he
            developed a unique approach that blends traditional wisdom with intuitive
            counselling.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            His sessions are gentle yet direct, offering clarity and practical steps. Whether
            you're navigating relationships, career changes or personal growth, Luv's aim is
            to guide you towards your own inner alignment.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Outside of readings, he continues to deepen his knowledge of energy work, spiritual
            psychology and mindfulness practices to better serve his clients.
